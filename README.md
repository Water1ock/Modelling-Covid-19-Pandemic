# Stochastic and Deterministic Modeling of COVID-19 Infection
1. Developed stochastic and deterministic models for COVID-19 infection dynamics, including a full SIR model.
2. Implemented Forward Euler method for solving ODEs and simulated infection spread using stochastic processes.
3. Analyzed the impact of different parameters on disease transmission using Python, NumPy, and Pandas.
